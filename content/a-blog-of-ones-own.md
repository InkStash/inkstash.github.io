I presume that anyone who has ever had a thought has wanted someone to share it with. It seems like such a natural thing, but then you don't want everyone to know about it either. I don't want to have to think things through too much, and oftentimes I just want to speak, even if no one's listening.

I am more in tune with technology than a majority of my peers, which could be the reason that I feel the necessity of having a blog – a place other than Facebook or similar social circles where I could speak my mind without worries. I tried writing stuff on Instagram for a while, a less populated place for me. I 'sort of' encrypted my writings in QR codes, as you have to post images on that platform. It's not really encryption since anyone could take the images, scan them, and find out what I've written. But then again, there's a layer of effort included in that process, which I rightly assumed wouldn't be present in most people seeing them.

I cannot outright say that a blog is the best thing I could've picked, but it feels 'mine', and that's more than I can say for most platforms I've written in. Certainly, I could write these thoughts in something like Evernote or Keep, and it's not like I haven't done those things already, but the appeal just isn't the same.

As my first post on the blog, this topic seemed right. Why have a blog in the first place? Who would read these things? Practically, no one. If you're reading this and you're not me, I am quite surprised. Knock me and let me know maybe? I don't know.

I haven't had a proper outlet for my thoughts in a long time, not enough people to speak with, I guess. I want to talk about a wild number of things, and no one's really listening. So I end up having monologues and dialogues in my head, and I end up losing them shortly after since I have no one to discuss them with. It's unlikely that I will look back at these ramblings too often, but they give me an opportunity I can find nowhere else.

I could just drop a link on Facebook, let anyone with enough time to waste a portal to read my words without wasting everyone's time with a paragraph. I know I'll attract more audience by writing directly to Facebook, but we've been over this, right? It's not quite 'me'.

If you're one of my few curious readers, a number I expect to be able to count on one hand, I don't have a lot to offer. This is going to be a platform for me to publish these ramblings I have, for the most part. I initially wanted to publish my creative works here, but I've since overturned that thought. It's not very convenient. You may find interesting stories about people in my life, perhaps with a pseudonym, but that's something I'll have to discover in future days.

If you need help starting a blog because you have no clue how any of this works, I am here. The 'unofficial' and 'closed' environment this blog emits is perhaps exactly what I wanted. Nothing too private, nothing too public – just right.
